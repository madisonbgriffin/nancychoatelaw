# About our Team!
We are ROAR! Our team consists of Madison Griffin and Hannah Lyons from Madison Academic High School. A fun fact about our team name is that it incorporates both of our last names. "Lyons" and "Griffin" correlate to animals so we thought "ROAR" was fitting for both our last names and our fierce personalities. 

We created a website for Nancy Choate, an Attorney at Spragins, Barnett, and Cobb, PLC. We spent time reviewing Nancy Choate's <a href="https://nancychoate.com/">original website</a>, and we immediately had ideas of how we could improve it, which we did in our project.
